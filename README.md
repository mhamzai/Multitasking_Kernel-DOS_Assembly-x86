# Multitasking_Kernel-DOS_Assembly-x86
The following Kernel written in x86 assembly allows non-preemptive multitasking on DOS in which there was no concept of threads and multitasking. This assembly code uses advantage of TSR(Terminate and stay resident) and ISR (interrupt service routine) of DOS to make it happen. The kernel maintains a PCB(Process Control Block) and allows Addition and Removal of multiple tasks in it's PCB, once it is run on DOS, tasks can be Paused, Resumed, Added and Removed from PCB utilizing interrupts for multitasking. The repository includes two timers which print on different parts DOS screen to test the multitasking of Multitasking_Kernel.
